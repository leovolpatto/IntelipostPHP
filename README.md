# IntelipostPHP
Intelipost SDK written in pure PHP

<h4>Configurations</h4>
You can insert this SDK structure inside your project without any problems, but first you have to check 2 things:
- Your API key should be placed in <b>IntelipostConfigurations.php</b>. It can be either a constant or a dynamic value from your DB
- Ensure that the <b>intelipost.inc.php</b> file is included in your script and also that the $projectRootPath variable is pointing to the exact place where this SDK is placed.
